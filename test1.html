        <p class="about_me_txt">&emsp; &emsp; Hello! My name is <b>Jim Slone</b>. I am a Senior Undergraduate Student at <b>William & Mary</b> studying
            <b>Physics</b> and <b>Data Science</b>. I am endlessly fascinated by Computational Physics, Machine Learning, and Scientific Research.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="about_me_txt">&emsp; &emsp; Currently, I am working as a <b>Research Assistant</b> in the William & Mary Physics Department under the supervision of
            <b>Prof. Saskia Mordijck</b>. My research focuses on using <b>Machine Learning Techniques</b> to infer Experimental Transport Conditions in Tokamak Reactors.
            This project has allowed me to wear many hats, diving into Computational Modeling, Numerical Methods, High-Performance Computing, Convolutional Neural Networks, Autoencoders,
            Generative ML, Reinforcement Learning, Uncertainty Quantification, Bayesian Optimization, and more.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="about_me_txt">&emsp; &emsp; In addition to my research, I am also a <b>Teaching Assistant</b> for the Data Science Department at William & Mary under <b>Prof. Daniel Vasiliu</b>, where I help
            with <b>Data 301: Applied Machine Learning</b>. I write class materials, write the homeworks and exams, hold office hours twice a week to help students, and answer students questions online.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="about_me_txt">&emsp; &emsp; In my free time, I enjoy working on personal coding projects, playing with my pets (both cats and <b>bunnies!</b>) and watching YouTube lectures/documentaries.
            I always enjoy learning new things and strive to be as well-rounded as possible! 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="about_me_txt">&emsp; &emsp; I am graduating in <b>May 2026</b> and am currently applying to graduate schools,
            with a primary focus on <b>Machine Learning Application to Plasma Physics</b>. If you have any questions about me or my work, feel free to reach out!
            I tend to check my email fairly often and respond quickly: <b>jvslone@wm.edu</b>.
