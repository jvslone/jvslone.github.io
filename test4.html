        <p class="about_me_txt">&emsp; &emsp; The second half of my Undergraduate experience has been shaped heavily by my role as a <b>Teaching Assistant</b> for DATA 301: Applied Machine Learning. Through this work, I have been able to put my passion for teaching others to use in a way that can help others.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="about_me_txt">&emsp; &emsp; I am responsible for <b>holding office hours</b> 1-2 times per week for around 2 hours each time and often hold <b>multiple extra sessions</b> to offer students additional help and accommodate everyone's specific schedules and needs. In addition, I <b>write all of the homeworks, review materials</b>, and the majority of the <b>exams</b> for the class, coming up with the problems, instructions, and answer keys. (See some examples below)

        <p class="about_me_txt">&emsp; &emsp; Overall, my contributions in trying to make the class <b></b>engaging and accommodate</b> has lead to a much higher level of <b>enthusiasm and participation</b>, fostering a much more <b>collaborative</b> environment than before, with the class maintaining a populated discord channel, one of the most active piazza sites on campus, and informal office hours with much higher attendance and popularity than before.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="about_me_txt">&emsp; &emsp; Overall I try my hardest to make sure that students know I am always a resource they can use for help and am more than willing to advocate on their behalf to ensure they get the more <b>fruitful and fair learning environment</b>.
